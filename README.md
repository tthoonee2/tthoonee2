-Hi, I’m @tthoonee2
I study political science and I am trying to increase my technicals skills by learning on my own programming languages
I am interested in Politics, social sciences, behaviours, news and social media.
The languages I am studying and practicing are: Python, C, HTML and XML, MySQL, VB.NET.
When I go crazy I like to experiment with the C derivatives and have fun with css.
looking forward to learn JS sooner or later.
